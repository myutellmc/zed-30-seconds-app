            <p className="mb-2">Two small things:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
              <li>
                <strong>Team and player names you type in, and game scores.</strong> When you play a round, the team
                names, the player names you enter, round scores, and the date of the game are sent to our backend
                (Convex, hosted in the United States) so the app can show team history. These names are only whatever
                text you choose to type &mdash; the app never asks for real names and does not verify them. Please
                avoid entering sensitive information as a team or player name.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Technical information from your network request.</strong> Like any website, our backend
                provider may automatically log your IP address and user-agent string for a short period as part of
                normal server operation. We do not use this to identify or profile you.

              Your theme preference (light / dark) and cached app files for offline play are stored on your device
              only. They are never transmitted to us. Uninstalling the app clears them.

            <p>
              Team and game records stay in the backend until we delete them or until you ask us to. To request
              deletion of any data you believe relates to you, email the address above with enough detail (e.g., the
              team name) to locate it. We will respond within 30 days.

            <p>
              Depending on where you live, you may have the right to access, correct, or delete any personal data we
              hold about you, to object to or restrict its processing, or to lodge a complaint with a data protection
              authority. For users in Zambia, that authority is the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner
              (dataprotection.gov.zm). For users in the EU/UK, it is your national data protection authority. Contact
              us first and we will try to resolve it directly.

            <p>
              Zed Rush is intended for players aged 13 and over. We do not knowingly collect personal data from
              children under 13. If you believe a child has entered data into the app, email us and we will remove
              anything we can identify.

            <p>
              Our backend is hosted in the United States, so team and game data you enter is transferred there. By
              using the app you consent to this transfer. We keep the data minimal and rely on our providers&rsquo;
              standard security measures (encryption in transit, restricted access).
